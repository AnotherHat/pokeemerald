## This is a feature branch for pokeemerald that adds a script-based debug menu.
To activate the menu, open your start menu and press Select. This can even be done inside the truck.

## Description of features:
Quick Start: Bypass all tutorials and set all game start variables/flags. It puts you at the point where you have left Birch's lab with the pokedex. You can do this from inside the truck to quickly begin testing something. This will also give you a lv100 mewtwo.

Quick Items: Gives 99 of the most useful items in the game, and gives all TM's and HM's

Utility Script: This is a blank option where you can put your own script in if you want to test something specific to your project. It's a better alternative to just putting random scripts on a sign in littleroot.

Teleportation: Sets all landmark flags and lets you teleport to any city or any branch of the battle frontier.

Change Time: Allows you to see and change the current RTC time.

All Badges: Gives you all 8 Hoenn league badges.

Heal Party: heal your party fully anywhere at any time.

Save File Usage: Shows a readout of how much save file space is free and used.

Close Menu: Closes the menu.

You're free to clone/merge/replicate this feature as well as edit it however you like. Credit isn't necessary. Just be sure to share it with your friends!
The menu itself is scripted in data/scripts/script_debug_menu.inc
